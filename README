This is a collection of tools for development and testing of the Intel DRM
driver.  There are many macro-level test suites that get used against our
driver, including xtest, rendercheck, piglit, and oglconform, but failures
from those can be difficult to track down to kernel changes, and many require
complicated build procedures or specific testing environments to get useful
results.

Thus, intel-graphics-tools was a project I started to collect some low-level
tools I intended to build.  There are 3 subdirectories:

benchmarks/
	This should be a collection of useful microbenchmarks.  The hope is
	that people can use these to tune some pieces of DRM code in relevant
	ways.

tests/
	This is a set of automated tests to run against the DRM to validate
	changes.  Hopefully this can cover the relevant cases we need to
	worry about, including backwards compatibility.

tools/
	This is a collection of debugging tools that had previously been
	built with the 2D driver but not shipped.  Some distros were hacking
	up the 2D build to ship them.  Instead, here's a separate package for
	people debugging the driver.

Note that most of these tools must be run as root.  Several tools require
MMIO register access (which may be denied if CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM is enabled).
When an X Server is running, benchmarks and tests clients won't be able to
run due to being unable to authenticate against it, unless you run them as
root.
